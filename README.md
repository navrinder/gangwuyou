# Golden Leaf API

If you have any questions or issues, please [create an Issue](https://github.com/tjbrennan/golden-leaf/issues/new)

###Connecting to the API

You can connect to the API on the Aliyun server by visiting:

	120.26.113.30:8080

The server is currently running in `development` mode. To log in as an `admin`, use these crendtials:

	email_address: test@test.com
	password: foobar

The admin account has full access to the API and create all items.


###Running locally

#####Requirements

- Node.js
- MySQL

Clone the project, `cd` into it and run `npm install`.

To start the project, run `node app` in the root of the directory.

#####Environment

The default environment is `development`. To run in production mode, run `NODE_ENV=production node app`.

#####Config

You must create a MySQL database locally and add the necessary info to `config.json`. You must also add a `secret` that will be used during authentication token creation.

#####Database

Before running locally, run `node db/createDatabase.js` to create the tables. You must specify the database credentials in `config.json`.

###Routes

All routes begin with `/api/v1`. `v1` indicates that this is version 1. The base URL `/` should respond with `hello world`. These documents can be viewed by visiting `/readme`.

###Authorization

All requests require an authentication token (except login and create user). The token is returned by the API when logging in. Some API calls can only be accessed by certain types of users.

The user types are `user`, `doctor`, and `admin`. An admin token can access any API call, but they can only be created manually in the database. To create an admin, you must log in to the MySQL database and set the user's `type` to `admin`.

They type of token required is specified below. In some cases, the API call can only be made if the `user_id` of the current user's token matches the `user_id` in the URL or the item being edited. This is referred to as `currentUser` in the documentation below.

The token should be included in the Authorization header:

	Authorization: <token>

###Return values

All responses are objects with the key `success`. If `success: true` the status will be `200` and the object will contain the key `data`. The data will come directly from the database as an object or array.

If `success: false` the status will be >= `400` and the object will contain the key `message` with details about the error. More detailed information is provided when in `developtment` mode.

###Removing items / The `active` key

Some API calls return items with the key `active: Y`. This should be checked for when receiving data. It indicates that the item exists and can be used. Making a `DELETE` call to remove an item sets the key to `active: N` indicating that the item has been removed. This way, the item can be removed from use while still preserving the data.




###Responses

####Success

Status: `200`
```
{
	success: true,
	data: {}
}
```

####Failure

Status: >= `400`
```
{
	success: false,
	code: ''
}
```
The response will contain `message` during development, but will not be shown in production. Do not use it in your code.
